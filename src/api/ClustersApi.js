/**
 * The Giant Swarm API v4
 * This is the documentation for the Giant Swarm API starting at version `v4`.  For an introduction to Giant Swarm, refer to the [documentation site](https://docs.giantswarm.io/).  The Giant Swarm API attempts to behave in a __restful__ way. As a developer, you acess recources using the `GET` method and, for example, delete them using the same path and the `DELETE` method.  Accessing resources via GET usually returns all information available about a resource, while collections, like for example the list of all clusters you have access to, only contain a selected few attributes of each member item.  Some requests, like for example the request to create a new cluster, don't return the resource itself. Instead, the response delivers a standard message body, showing a `code` and a `message` part. The `message` contains information for you or a client's end user. The `code` attribute contains some string (example: `RESOURCE_CREATED`) that is supposed to give you details on the state of the operation, in addition to standard HTTP status codes. This message format is also used in the case of errors. We provide a [list of all response codes](https://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec/blob/master/details/RESPONSE_CODES.md) outside this documentation.  Feedback on the API as well as this documentation is welcome via `support@giantswarm.io` or on IRC channel [#giantswarm](irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#giantswarm) on freenode.  ## Source  The source of this documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec).

     * Create cluster
     * This operation is used to create a new Kubernetes cluster for an organization. The desired configuration can be specified using the __cluster definition format__ (see [external documentation](https://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec/blob/master/details/CLUSTER_DEFINITION.md) for details).  The cluster definition format allows to set a number of optional configuration details, like memory size and number of CPU cores. However, one attribute is __mandatory__ upon creation: The &#x60;owner&#x60; attribute must carry the name of the organization the cluster will belong to. Note that the acting user must be a member of that organization in order to create a cluster.  It is *recommended* to also specify the &#x60;name&#x60; attribute to give the cluster a friendly name, like e. g. \&quot;Development Cluster\&quot;.  Additional definition attributes can be used. Where attributes are ommitted, default configuration values will be applied. For example, if no &#x60;release_version&#x60; is specified, the most recent version is used.  The &#x60;workers&#x60; attribute, if present, must contain an array of node definition objects. The number of objects given determines the number of workers created.  For example, requesting three worker nodes with default configuration can be achieved by submitting an array of three empty objects:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;\&quot;workers\&quot;: [{}, {}, {}]&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  For clusters on AWS, note that all worker nodes must use the same instance type.

    /**
     * Modify cluster
     * This operation allows to modify an existing cluster.  A cluster modification is performed by submitting a &#x60;PATCH&#x60; request to the cluster resource (as described in the [addCluster](#operation/addCluster) and [getCluster](#operation/getCluster)) in form of a [JSON Patch Merge (RFC 7386)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386). This means, only the attributes to be modified have to be contained in the request body.  The following attributes can be modified:  - &#x60;name&#x60;: Rename the cluster to something more fitting.  - &#x60;owner&#x60;: Changing the owner organization name means to change cluster ownership from one organization to another. The user performing the request has to be a member of both organizations.  - &#x60;workers&#x60;: By modifying the array of workers, nodes can be added to increase the cluster&#39;s capacity. See details below.  ### Adding and Removing Worker Nodes (Scaling)  Adding worker nodes to a cluster or removing worker nodes from a cluster works by submitting the &#x60;workers&#x60; attribute, which contains a (sparse) array of worker node defintions.  _Sparse_ here means that all configuration details are optional. In the case that worker nodes are added to a cluster, wherever a configuration detail is missing, defaults will be applied. See [Creating a cluster](#operation/addCluster) for details.  When modifying the cluster resource, you describe the desired state. For scaling, this means that the worker node array submitted must contain as many elements as the cluster should have worker nodes. If your cluster currently has five nodes and you submit a workers array with four elements, this means that one worker node will be removed. If your submitted workers array has six elements, this means one will be added.  As an example, this request body could be used to scale a cluster to three worker nodes:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json {   \&quot;workers\&quot;: [{}, {}, {}] } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  If the scaled cluster had four worker nodes before, one would be removed. If it had two worker nodes before, one with default settings would be added.  ### Limitations  - Adding and removing worker nodes is currently only supported on AWS-based installations, not on KVM-based ones. - As of now, existing worker nodes cannot be modified. - When removing nodes (scaling down), it is not possible to determine which nodes will be removed. - On AWS based clusters, all worker nodes must use the same EC2 instance type (&#x60;instance_type&#x60; node attribute). By not setting an &#x60;instance_type&#x60; when submitting a PATCH request, you ensure that the right instance type is used automatically.
